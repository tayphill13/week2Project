## _Programming Language Selection Simulator_ 


#### _Programming Language Random Selector, 6.5.20_

#### By _**Taylor Phillips at Epicodus**_

## Description

_This program will allow user to answer questions and receive back a suggestion of a coding language they might enjoy.  The results are determined only by the users' choice of donut and preference of nights or mornings.  There are 5 different possible results including Ruby, C#, HTMl/CSS, Python and Rust.  I have also included an alert if user doesn't make a donut selection or if the user selects a donut, but does not answer the morning or night question.  In the future I will implement an alert when user leaves any selection blank/blank form._
